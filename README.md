# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard

**The Weather Dashboard provides real-time and forecasted weather insights for multiple cities. It visualizes temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality, and rain probability through interactive cards and charts.
This dashboard helps users monitor climate conditions, track daily forecasts, and analyze air quality trends effectively.**

## ❓ Problem Statement

**People often face difficulty tracking accurate and detailed weather conditions in one place.
This project aims to build a centralized Weather Dashboard that provides:**

* Real-time weather data

* Future temperature and rain forecasts

* Air quality levels with pollutant breakdown

* Daily sunrise and sunset times

**The goal is to help users plan their day better and stay informed about environmental health.**

## 💡 Solution Overview

**The Weather Dashboard integrates multiple environmental and meteorological KPIs into a single visual report.
It allows users to switch between cities and observe changes in weather parameters, air quality, and rain forecasts.
With dynamic visuals and real-time updates, the dashboard simplifies decision-making and improves weather awareness.**

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Current Temperature (°C)** — Shows the real-time temperature of the selected city.

* **Weather Condition** — Displays the current climate (e.g., rain, cloud, sun).

* **City Selector** — Enables comparison between cities such as Surat, Pune, and New Delhi.

* **Humidity (%)** — Represents air moisture level.

* **Wind Speed (kph)** — Displays wind flow speed.

* **Visibility (kph)** — Indicates clarity of atmospheric view.

* **Pressure (hPa)** — Displays current atmospheric pressure.
